# scriptlets
A collection of scriptlets in various languages.

These scriptlets are not the best examples of code as they are mostly things I've thrown together quickly.
They may or may not be well commented and they may or may not handle errors or unexpected inputs well.

In many cases these scriptlets were not necessarily intended for distribution and thus may have other special requirements regarding data formats. Since these were mostly designed to save myself time and not intended as anything other than stand-alone scripts for personal use, if it came down to a choice between doing it quick and dirty vs taking the time to do it clean and right, quick and dirty won most of the time.
